# GIMP Stable Boy Specifications

This document outlines the specifications for the GIMP Stable Boy plugin. It serves as the definitive guide for all development and refactoring efforts.

## Core Principles

* **Adherence to this document:** This document is the single source of truth. All changes must align with the specifications detailed here.
* **Modularity:** The application should be broken down into small, reusable components with single responsibilities.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase should be clean, well-documented, and easy for human developers to understand and modify.
* **Clarity:** The folder and file structure should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

## Refactoring Tasks

* **Component Modularization:** Break down the existing application into smaller, highly cohesive, and reusable components.
* **Organized Structure:** Implement a clear, intuitive, and easy-to-understand folder and organization schema for the entire repository.

## Documentation Tasks

* **Comprehensive Documentation Update:** After completing the refactoring, thoroughly update all relevant documentation to reflect the new structure and component breakdown.
* **Folder Structure Elucidation:** Explicitly highlight and explain the newly established folder structures.
* **Component and Function Clarity:** For each newly created or refactored component, script, or function, provide updated documentation that details its specific objective and functionality.
* **Overarching Goal:** The primary goal of this refactoring and documentation effort is to significantly enhance the ease of human debugging and future development.

## Command Structure

The plugin's functionality is organized into a series of commands. Each command is a self-contained class that inherits from `StableBoyCommand` or `StableDiffusionCommand`.

### Adding New Commands

To add a new command, create a new Python file in the `src/gimp_stable_boy/commands` directory. This file should contain a class that inherits from one of the base command classes. The new class should implement the following:

* `proc_name`: A unique name for the command.
* `menu_label`: The label that will be displayed in the GIMP menus.
* `add_arguments`: A class method that defines the command's arguments.
* `run`: The main method that executes the command's logic.

The plugin's entry point, `main.py`, will automatically discover and load any new commands placed in the `commands` directory.
